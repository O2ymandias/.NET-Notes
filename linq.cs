// * var VS dynamic
/*
    [1] var (Implicitly Typed Variable)
        1. Compiler can detect data type based on the initial value at (Compilation Time).
        2. Must be initialized.
        3. Can't be initialized with null (null itself doesn't specify a type, so compiler can't detect data type).
        4. Can't change its data type after initialization.
        5. Performance: No runtime overhead since type checking happens at compile time.

        Example
            var number = 10; ❕Compiler infers "int".
            var number; ❌ Error: Must be initialized.
            var number = null ❌ Error: Can't be initialized with null.
            number = "10" ❌ Error: Can't change its data type after initialization.

    [2] dynamic (Dynamic Type)
        1. Compiler will skip type checking at (Compilation Time).
        2. CLR will resolve the actual type of the dynamic time at (RunTime).
        3. Does not need to be initialized.
        4. Can be initialized with null.
        5. Can be reassigned to any data type.
        6. Performance overhead due to runtime type resolution.

        Example
            dynamic value = 10; ❕Initially an int.
            value = "Hello"; ❕Now a string (No compile-time error).
            dynamic value = null; ❕Can be initialized with null.
            dynamic value; ❕Does not need to be initialized.

// * Extension Method
/*
    ❕Allows you to add new methods to an existing type without modifying the original type.

    🗒️How to Create an Extension Method?
        1. The method must be static.
        2. It must be inside a (non-generic, static) class.
        3. The first parameter should use this keyword followed by the type you want to extend.
        4. You can call it like an instance method on objects of that type.

    🗒️Example
        static class IntExtensions
        {
            public static int Reverse(this int number) ‼️(this int) -> Extends type int 
            {
                int reversedNumber = 0, reminder = 0;

                while (number != 0)
                {
                    reminder = number % 10;
                    reversedNumber = reversedNumber * 10 + reminder;
                    number /= 10;
                }

                return reversedNumber;
            }
        }

        int x = 12345;
		int reversedX = x.Reverse();
*/

// * Anonymous Type
/*
    Temporary, lightweight object type that allows you to create an object without explicitly defining a class.
    It is useful when you need to store data quickly without creating a separate model class.


    🗒️Key Features:
        1. Defined using new { } syntax.
            var employeeOne = new {Id = "123", Name = "Nael", Salary = 10_000}

            var employeeTwo = new {Id = "321", Name = "Max", Salary = 9_999}
            ❕Will the compiler generate a new type ?
                Compiler reuses the same anonymous type as long as the signature (property names, order, and data types) remains identical.

                Console.WriteLine(employeeOne.GetType() == employeeTwo.GetType()); ‼️True

        2. Properties are read-only (Immutable).
            var employeeOne = new {Id = "123", Name = "Nael", Salary = 10_000}
            employeeOne.Id = "999" ❌
            ❕ This is how you can mutate it:
                employeeOne = employeeOne with {Id = "999"}
            
        3. The type is inferred at compile-time.

        4. Typically used with LINQ queries.

// * LINQ Intro
/*
    ❕Stand for Language Integrated Query 
    ❕40+ extension methods to IEnumerable<T> interface, existing at Enumerable class 
    ❕You can use LINQ operators against data (Stored as Sequence) regardless of the data store [SQL Server / Oracle / MYSQL] 

    🗒️Sequence
        Object from any class that implements IEnumerable [List, Array, Dictionary]

        ❕There are two types of sequence: 
            Local Sequence (In memory collection):
                L2O (LINQ To Object): Works on collections like List<T>, Array, Dictionary<K,V>.
                L2XML (LINQ To XML): Used for querying and manipulating XML documents. 

            Remote Sequence (External Data Sources): 
                ✔ L2E (LINQ to Entities): Works with Entity Framework to query databases.

    🗒️Syntax
        [1] Fluent Syntax
            1.1 As a static methods through Enumerable class
                var odds = Enumerable.Where(numbers, number => number % 2 == 1);

            1.2 As extension methods
                var odds = numbers.where(number => number % 2 == 1)

        [2] Query Expression
            Always begins with a (from) clause that introduces a range variable (means a variable that represents each element of the sequence).
            Can include various clauses like (where, orderby, join)
            Ends with either (select or group by).

            Example
                var odds = from number in numbers
                where number % 2 == 1
                select number;
    🗒️LINQ Execution
        ❕Deferred Execution
            The query execution is delayed until the sequence is iterated.
            Works on the latest state of the sequence. 
            All LINQ operators are deferred except: 
                1. Element Operators (First(), Last(), Single(), etc.)
                2. Aggregate Operators (Count(), Sum(), Average(), etc.)
                3. Casting Operators (ToList(), ToArray(), ToDictionary())

            Example
                var numbers = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
                var odds = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 1);
                numbers.AddRange([11, 12, 13, 14, 15]);
                foreach (var number in odds)
                    Console.WriteLine(number); // 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15

        Immediate Execution
            The query executes immediately and stores the result.
            Does NOT reflect later changes to the source collection. 
            Forced by (Casting/Element/Aggregate) operators.

            Example
                var numbers = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };
                var odds = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 1).ToList();
                numbers.AddRange([11, 12, 13, 14, 15]);
                foreach (var number in odds)
                    Console.WriteLine(number); // 1,3,5,7,9

        Count()
            ❕What is the difference between Count property & Count()
                [1] Count Property
                    Applies to: sequences that implement ICollection<T> (e.g., List<T>, HashSet<T>, Dictionary<T>).

                    Performance: O(1) (Constant time) because it directly returns the stored count.

                [2] Count()
                    Applies to: Any IEnumerable<T> (including IQueryable<T> for LINQ-to-SQL).
                    Performance:
                        O(1) if the underlying sequence implements ICollection<T> (it internally uses .Count property).

                        O(n) (Iterates through the entire sequence) if the sequence does not implement ICollection<T>.

        Max()
            If selector provided (x => x.propertyName) 
                Equivalent to Select(x => x.propertyName).Max()
            If NOT
                Type MUST implement IComparable Interface (no selector provided).
        Min()
        MaxBy()
            Equivalent to OrderByDescending().FirstOrDefault(); 
        MinBy()
        Sum() 
        Average() 
        Aggregate()
            [1] Aggregate(
                ❕Func<AccumulatorValue, NextElement, TResult>
                    1st Param: Accumulator Value, If no seed provided, it will be assigned to the first element of the sequence.
                    2nd Param: The next element of the sequence.
                    TResult: Will be the next accumulator value.

                ❕TAccumulate seed,
                    seed: Initial Accumulator Value

                ❕Func<AccumulatorValue, NextElement, TResult>

    🗒️Casting Operators (Immediate Execution)
        ToList() 
        ToArray() 
        ToDictionary(Func<T, TKey> keySelector) 
        ToHashSet()

    🗒️Generator Operators
        These methods don't work on a sequence, the only way to call them is as static methods via Enumerable class 
        Range() 
        Repeat() 
        Empty()

    🗒️Set Operators
        Union() 
            Removes duplications
        Concat() [Union All] 
            Doesn't remove duplications 
            Union() = Concat() + Distinct() 
        Intersect()  
        Except() [Minus]

        UnionBy()
        IntersectBy()
        ExceptBy()

    ❕Default Equality Comparer in LINQ
        Set operators (Union(), Intersect(), and Except()) use default equality comparer to compare values.

        For Value Types (int, string, etc.)
            Comparisons are made based on values.

        For Reference Types (Objects, Classes)
            Comparisons are based on reference (memory address).
            Two objects are considered equal only if they share the same reference.
            If you want custom comparison you can
                -> Override Equals() and GetHashCode().
                    If the comparison will always between same type, it's recommended to implement IEquatable<T> Interface.

                -> Pass an obj of a class that implements IEqualityComparer to the set operator

                -> Use
                    UnionBy()
                    IntersectBy()
                    ExceptBy()


    🗒️Quantifiers Operators 
        Returns boolean value. 
        Any()
            ❕Which is better any() or count() > 0
                ❕If the sequence is doesn't implement ICollection<T>
                    Any() is more efficient.
                        Any(): It short-circuits and returns as soon as it finds the first element
                        Count() will iterate through the entire collection to count the elements.

                ❕If the sequence implements ICollection
                    .Count/Length: is the most efficient (Direct property access O(1))
                    Count(): is efficient because it simply returns .Count (also O(1)).
                    Any(): is efficient because it returns .Count != 0 (also O(1)). 

        All() 
        SequenceEquals () 
            Returns True if the two sequences are of equal length AND the corresponding elements are equal according to default equality comparer, otherwise False 

    🗒️Grouping Operators
        GroupBy()

    🗒️Partitioning Operators
        Take() 
        TakeLast() 
        Skip() 
        SkipLast() 
        TakeWhile() 
        SkipWhile()
