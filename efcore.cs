// * Intro
/*
    üóíÔ∏èWhat is Entity Framework Core (EF Core)
        Is an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET that allows developers to work with databases using C# objects instead of writing SQL queries manually.

    üóíÔ∏èKey Features of EF Core:
        Cross-platform ‚Äì> Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

        Supports both
            Code-First Approach ‚Äì> Define your database structure using C# classes (models).
            Database-First Approach ‚Äì> Generate C# classes from an existing database.

        Migrations ‚Äì> Manage schema changes without losing data.

        LINQ Queries ‚Äì> Use LINQ to query databases instead of raw SQL.

        Change Tracking ‚Äì> Detects and tracks changes in entities for efficient updates.

        Lazy & Eager Loading ‚Äì> Controls how related data is loaded to optimize performance.

    üóíÔ∏èEntity Framework Core (EF Core) Inheritance Mapping Strategies
        Define how object-oriented class hierarchies are represented in relational databases.

        [1] Table Per Hierarchy (TPH)
            ‚úî Single table for the entire inheritance hierarchy.
            ‚úî Discriminator column identifies entity type.
            ‚úî Fastest query performance (no joins).
            ‚ùå NULL values.

            Example
                public class Employee
                {
                    public int Id { get; set; }
                    public string Name { get; set; }
                }

                public class FullTimeEmployee : Employee
                {
                    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
                }

                public class PartTimeEmployee : Employee
                {
                    public decimal HourlyRate { get; set; }
                }

                ‚ùïGenerated SQL
                CREATE TABLE Employees (
                    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    Name NVARCHAR(MAX),
                    Salary DECIMAL(18,2), 
                    HourlyRate DECIMAL(18,2),
                    Discriminator NVARCHAR(MAX)
                        ‚ùïStores "Employee", "FullTimeEmployee", or "PartTimeEmployee"
                );

        [2] Table Per Type (TPT)
            ‚úî Separate tables for base and derived types.
            ‚úî No NULL fields.
            ‚ùå Performance cost due to JOINs.

            Example
                public class Employee
                {
                    public int Id { get; set; }
                    public string Name { get; set; }
                }

                public class FullTimeEmployee : Employee
                {
                    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
                }

                public class PartTimeEmployee : Employee
                {
                    public decimal HourlyRate { get; set; }
                }

                ‚ùïGenerated SQL
                CREATE TABLE Employees (
                    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    Name NVARCHAR(MAX)
                );

                CREATE TABLE FullTimeEmployees (
                    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    Salary DECIMAL(18,2),
                    FOREIGN KEY (Id) REFERENCES Employees(Id)
                );

                CREATE TABLE PartTimeEmployees (
                    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    HourlyRate DECIMAL(18,2),
                    FOREIGN KEY (Id) REFERENCES Employees(Id)
                );

        [3] Table Per Concrete Type (TPC)
            ‚úî Each concrete class has its own table.
            ‚úî No discriminator column or foreign keys.
            ‚ùå No shared base table for common fields -> Leads to larger database size.

            Example
                public class Employee
                {
                    public int Id { get; set; }
                    public string Name { get; set; }
                }

                public class FullTimeEmployee : Employee
                {
                    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
                }

                public class PartTimeEmployee : Employee
                {
                    public decimal HourlyRate { get; set; }
                }

                ‚ùïGenerated SQL
                CREATE TABLE FullTimeEmployees (
                    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    Name NVARCHAR(MAX),
                    Salary DECIMAL(18,2)
                );

                CREATE TABLE PartTimeEmployees (
                    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    Name NVARCHAR(MAX),
                    HourlyRate DECIMAL(18,2)
                );

// * Mapping

// üóíÔ∏èBy Convention [DEFAULT]
/*
    [1] Primary Key
        EF Core will look for a public numeric property named Id or <EntityName>Id and mark it as the primary key (PK).
        This PK will be marked as an Identity Column
            INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY

        Example:
            public class User
            {
                public int Id { get; set; } // PK by convention
                public string Name { get; set; }
            }   

    [2] Foreign Keys & Relationships
        If a navigation property has a corresponding <NavigationPropertyName>Id, EF Core treats it as a foreign key.
        
        Example (One-to-Many):
        public class Order
        {
            public int Id { get; set; } // PK
            public int UserId { get; set; } // FK by convention
            public User User { get; set; } // Navigation property
        }

    [3] One-to-Many Relationship
        - A collection navigation property in one entity and a reference navigation property in the other define a one-to-many relationship.
        Example:
        public class User
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }
            public ICollection<Order> Orders { get; set; } // One-to-Many
        }

        public class Order
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }
            public int UserId { get; set; }
            public User User { get; set; }
        }

    [4] Many-to-Many Relationship
        - EF Core automatically creates a join table if both sides have collection navigation properties.
        Example:
        public class Student
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }
            public ICollection<Course> Courses { get; set; }
        }

        public class Course
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }
            public ICollection<Student> Students { get; set; }
        }

    [5] Nullable & Non-Nullable Properties

        Reference Types (string)
            In .NET 5, all string properties are optional (NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL).
            In .NET 6+,
                non-nullable string (string Name) is required (NVARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL).
                nullable string (string? Name) is optional (NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL).

        Value Types (int, decimal)
            Non-nullable value types (int, decimal) ‚Üí NOT NULL.
            Nullable value types (int?, decimal?) ‚Üí NULL.

        Example
            public class Employee
            {
                public int Id { get; set; }
                    PK ‚Üí INT IDENTITY(1,1)

                public string Name { get; set; }
                    .NET 5 ‚Üí NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL [OPTIONAL]
                    .NET 6+ ‚Üí NVARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL [REQUIRED]

                public string? Email { get; set; }
                    NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL [OPTIONAL]

                public int Age { get; set; }
                    INT NOT NULL [REQUIRED]

                public int? Bonus { get; set; }
                    INT NULL [OPTIONAL]

                public decimal Salary { get; set; }
                    DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL [REQUIRED]
            }

*/

// üóíÔ∏èBy Data Annotation
/*
    Attributes applied to model properties to configure how they should be mapped to the database.

    [Key] 
        Marks the property as PK.
        If the property is of type int or long, it will use identity constraint

    [DatabaseGenerated()]
        Controls how values are generated for a database column.
        it accepts a DatabaseGeneratedOption enum, which has three options:
            1. DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity
                This makes the database auto-generate values for columns (using an identity constraint  IDENTITY(1,1))

            2. DatabaseGeneratedOption.Computed
                Marks a Property as Computed.
                It is NOT necessary if you use Fluent API (.HasComputedColumnSql()).
                Fluent API (.HasComputedColumnSql()) explicitly defines how the computation is done in SQL.
                The attribute is only useful when the database already has a computed column, and you want EF Core to recognize it without modifying it.

            3. DatabaseGeneratedOption.None
                The database does not auto-generate or compute the value.
                The application must manually assign a value before inserting a record.


    [Required]
        To explicitly make a column as required [NOT NULL] , to avoid .NET versions conflicts.
        public class Employee


    [StringLength()] & [MaxLength()]
        Both affects database scheme.
        
        StringLength()
        ASP.NET MVC/API: Validates user input


    [Column("ColumnName", TypeName = "SQLType")]
        If you want to change the column name or specify the data type


    [ForeignKey("NavigationProperty")]
        Defines foreign key relationships.

    [Table]
        If you want to explicitly specify a different table name (or schema),

    [NotMapped]
        specify that a particular property should not be mapped to a database column.



    üóíÔ∏èAttributes doesn't affect the database scheme.
        [RegularExpression]
        [Compare]
        [Range]
        [Email]

/*
    Provides a way to configure entity properties, relationships, and constraints directly in the OnModelCreating method of DbContext.

    ‚ùïSome API Methods
        .ToTable("TableName")
            Maps an entity to a specific table name.

        .Entity<EntityType>()
            .HasKey(x => x.Id)
                Defines the primary key.

        .Property(x => x.PropertyName) || .Property(nameof(Entity.PropertyName)) || .Property("PropertyName")
            .IsRequired(): Makes a property NOT NULL.
            .HasMaxLength(): Limits the length of a string column.
            .HasColumnName(): Maps a property to a specific column name.
            .UseIdentityColumn(): Configures the identity constraint.
            .HasDefaultValue():
                Use when setting a fixed, constant default value.
                The value is set at insert if no value is provided.

            .HasDefaultValueSql("GETDATE()"):
                Use when the default value should be generated dynamically using SQL.
                The value is computed at insert using a SQL function.

            .HasComputedColumnSql():
                Use when the column value should be calculated dynamically based on other columns.
                The database recalculates it on every query.


        .HasOne().WithMany()
            Configures one-to-many relationships.

        .HasForeignKey("FK")
            Specifies the foreign key column.

        .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade)
            Configures delete behavior for related entities.

// * DbContext
/*
    Each database provider has its own version of DbContext
    You need to Install the database provider package to get an access to the required DbContext.
        SQL Server:	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

        PostgreSQL:	Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
        MySQL: Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql (community-supported)
        Oracle:	Oracle.EntityFrameworkCore

    DbContext is an abstract class, acts as a bridge between your application and the database:
        Manages Database Connections: Opens and closes connections automatically.
        Tracks Changes: Keeps track of entity states (Added, Modified, Deleted, UnChanged).
        Executes Queries: Translates LINQ queries into SQL and fetches data.
        Handles Transactions: Ensures data consistency through SaveChanges().
        Configures Entities: Defines relationships and constraints via Fluent API or Data Annotations.

// * using & try-finally
/*
    using 
        It ensures that the object (Implements IDisposable) is disposed of/ cleaned up/ released at the end of the block, even if an exception occurs.
        DbContext in RF Core implements IDisposable.

        Example
            using (var dbContext = new AppDbContext())
            {
                CRUD Operations
            }

            More Syntactic Sugar
                using var dbContext = new AppDbContext();

    try-finally
        You manually call Dispose() in the finally block, ensuring the connection is closed even if an exception is thrown.
        This approach can be useful if you need to add extra logic before or after disposing of the resource

        Example
            var dbContext = new AppDbContext();
            try
            {
